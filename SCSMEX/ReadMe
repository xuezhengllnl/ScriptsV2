TRMM SCSMEX Budget Analysis from 06:00 GMT 5/6/1998 to 12:00 GMT 6/20/1998

Update on 8/23/2005

3 hourly precipitation from TRMM 3b42_v6, averaged over the variational domain 
from Paul Ciesielski at CSU, has been used in this update of the analysis. 
Details of the precipitation data can be found at http://tornado.atmos.colostate.edu/scsmexdata. 

===================================

Version 0 6/28/2002

The two fortran programs read the two ascii data files for single-level and
multi-level fields respectively.  The netcdf file contains all the data.  The 
files are self-explanatory.

This is a preliminary release. Future revision is anticated as
better estimates of surface rainfall (e.g., from radar products) and
latent and sensible heat fluxes become available.


 Special thanks to:

 Paul Ciesielski and Dick Johnson at the Colorado State University
 for their active participation in the project.


 This version of the variational budget analysis has used the 
 following data sources:

 1. TRMM SCSMEX field campaign soundings and operational soundings
     quality controlled by the CSU group, with soundings below 700 mb
     from station Laoag masked as missing as discussed in Johnson and 
     Ciesielski (2002). 

 2. Surface latent and sensible heat fluxes from the adjusted JMA analysis 
    by using the ship measurements from Shiyan as prepared by Paul Ciesielski.

 3. ISCCP TOA and surface radiative fluxes and cloud information from
    Bill Rossow's group at GISS

 4. Surface precipitation from the combined TRMM product (3B42) and the daily 
   GPCP rainfall supplied by Paul Ciesielski. 

 5. JMA analysis of upper air fields and other surface meteorological 
    variables supplied by Paul Ciesielski.


 These data sources have been used to obtain the best estimates of 
 area-averaged variables for the analysis domain.  They are then
 subjected to the constrained variational analysis of Zhang et al. 
 (MWR, 2001). 


Description of data sources for each variable in the released data:
 
6-hourly time series of single-level fields:

1.	surface precipitation

Daily rainfalls from the TRMM combined product (3B42) and GPCP are both averaged in the 
budget domain (see web http://atmgcm.msrc.sunysb.edu/trmm/trmmscmx/mainscmx.html)  form 
two daily time series.   They are then averaged and positive-splined fitted to form the 
six-hour averages.   

2.	surface latent heat flux

This is from the JMA analysis of latent heat flux adjusted to the ship LH measurements at 
Shiyan as provided by Paul Ciesielski, and averaged to the budget domain. 

3.	surface sensible heat flux

Same as above

4.	surface pressure

JMA analysis and compared with measurements at DongSha Island.

5.	surface air temperature

Same as above

6.	surface wind speed

Same as above

7. surface u wind

Same as above

8. surface v wind

Same as above

9. surface net downward radiation

Domain averaged ISCCP radiation fluxes.

10. surface upward shortwave radiation

Same as above

11. surface downward shortwave radiation

Same as above

12. surface upward longwave radiation

Same as above

13. surface downward longwave radiation

Same as above

14. TOA upward shortwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

15. TOA downward shortwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

16. TOA upward longwave radiation

ISCCP averaged

17. ISCCP clound amount

18. Time derivative of column precipitable water

From the analyzed sounding data.  Note that vertical integration uses the analyzed surface 
pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.

19. Column integrated horizontal transport of water vapor

From the variational analysis.  Note that vertical integration uses the analyzed surface 
pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.

20. Surface evaporation

See surface latent heat flux.  This variable is provided here to check the column moisture 
budget in the unit of (mm/hour)

21. Time derivative of dry static energy

Same as above

22. Column integrated horizontal transport of dry static energy.  Note that vertical integration 
uses the analyzed surface pressure and the 100 mb as the top pressure of the integration.
 
Same as above

23. Column integrated radiative heating

Derived from the above surface and TOA radiative fluxes

23. Column integrated latent heating

Derived from surface precipitation.  This variable is provided here to check the column energy 
budget

Input data are 23 sounding stations adjacent to the budget domain (see "Domain" on 
http://atmgcm.msrc.sunysb.edu/trmm/trmmscmx/mainscmx.html). The 
JMA upper air analysis has been used as a background and initial guess.
