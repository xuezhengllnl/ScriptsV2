SGS_TKE/tke_full.f90

Peter Blossey fixed an issue with some noise generated in the very beginning of runs associated with lack of synchronization between SGS turbulence production terms. This issue occurs only in the updated version of the file introduced in version 6.10.9.


stepout.f90
main.f90

Fixed incorrect printout of water conservation statistics in case when NCYCLE > 1. Does not affect the computations themselves, only printout.


write_fields2D.f90
write_fields3D.f90

Changed the format of writing dx and dy to the output files from f12.0 to f12.5 to allow for correct whiteout of small grid-spacings. Does not affect any computations themselves.
