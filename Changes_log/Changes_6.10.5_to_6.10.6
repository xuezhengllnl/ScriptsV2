UW group pointed out that the saturation vapor pressure over salty sea water is actually slightly smaller than over fresh water. The factor is 0.981. Doesn't seem like much, but for 90% relative humidity air, that 2% difference in saturation pressure translates into 20% change in evaporation flux, which can be substantial especially when someone tries to match the observations. To fix the problem, a new logical flag is introduced, doseawater. When set to true, the sea-water flux computations (oceflx.f90) will take the salt effect on saturation into account. Note that by default it is set to false, that is by default fresh water is assumed. 

- the maximum number of time step divisions (time subcycling) can be now set by the namelist variable ncycle_max. Default is 4.

- SAM has always been compiled as a single-precision (4-byte real) code; however, starting from 6.10.6, it can be safely compiled and run in double precision mode (8-byte real) by specifying compiler option to set the default size of real to 8 bytes (in intel compile -r8 compiler flag). Regardless of the choice, all the output files will still be written using real of 4 bytes. Note that one of the reasons why I previously avoided running in double-precision mode is because of some large performance penalty of running real(8) code, because of the larger MPI message sizes, and some hardware slowdown. Probably, now the penalty is not that severe due to hardware improvements.
