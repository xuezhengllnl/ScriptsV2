A number of statistics and 2D outputs have been added to the model.
In addition, the mechanism by which conditional averages
(e.g. in-cloud averages) has been changed.  Further, an option
(dosatupdnconditionals) has been added to the PARAMETERS namelist
which enables the output of conditional averages for cloudy updrafts,
cloudy downdrafts and environmental (cloud-free) air.

First, the following 2D outputs have been added:

  name='PSFC', long_name='P at the surface', units='mbar'
  name='SWVP', long_name='Saturated Water Vapor Path', units='mm'
  name='U850', long_name='850 mbar zonal velocity', units='m/s'
  name='V850', long_name='850 mbar meridional velocity', units='m/s'
  name='ZC',   long_name='Cloud top height (Instantaneous)', units='km'
  name='TB',   long_name='Cloud top temperature (Instantaneous)', units='K'
  name='ZE',   long_name='Echo top height (Instantaneous)', units='km'

NOTES: 
  1) ZC, TB, ZE are instantaneous 2D profiles.  The others are
       time-averaged.
  2) ZC is the height where the downward-integrated LWP+IWP exceeds
       0.01 kg/m2.  TB is the temperature at this height.
  3) ZE is the highest level where qg+qs+qr > 0.001 g/kg.
  4) SWVP is the equivalent of WVP, but where the saturation mixing
       ratio (with respect to water) is used at each height.

Second, the following horizontall-averaged statistics have been added
to the stat file and need to be appended to the lst file for their
output:

1  0 'QVTEND'	'Large-Scale Vertical Advection Moisture Tendency','g/kg/day'
1  0 'QHTEND'	'Large-Scale Horizontal Advection Moisture Tendency','g/kg/day'
1  0 'QNUDGE'	'Large-Scale Moisture Nudging','g/kg/day'
1  0 'THTEND'	'Large-Scale Horizontal Advection Temperature Tendency','K/day'
1  0 'TVTEND'	'Large-Scale Vertical Advection Temperature Tendency','K/day'
1  0 'TNUDGE'	'Large-Scale Temperature Nudging','K/day'
1  0 'WSTAR3'	'Value at inversion is w*^3 (conv. vel. scale)','m3/s3'
1  0 'UADV'	'Resolved zonal momentum flux convergence','m/s/day'
1  0 'VADV'	'Resolved meridioinal momentum flux convergence','m/s/day'
1  0 'UDIFF'	'Subgrid zonal momentum flux convergence','m/s/day'
1  0 'VDIFF'	'Subgrid meridioinal momentum flux convergence','m/s/day'
1  0 'UNUDGE'	'Zonal velocity nudging','m/s/day'
1  0 'VNUDGE'	'Meridional velocity nudging','m/s/day'
1  0 'ULSADVV'	'Large-scale vertical advection of Zonal velocity','m/s/day'
1  0 'VLSADVV'	'Large-scale vertical advection of meridional velocity','m/s/day'
1  0 'USTOR'	'Zonal velocity storage','m/s/day'
1  0 'VSTOR'	'Meridional velocity storage','m/s/day'
1  0 'UTENDCOR'	'Zonal velocity tendency due to Coriolis effect','m/s/day'
1  0 'URESID'	'Zonal velocity budget residual','m/s/day'
1  0 'VTENDCOR'	'Meridional velocity budget residual','m/s/day'
1  0 'VRESID'	'Meridional velocity budget residual','m/s/day'
1  0 'HLSTOR'	'Liquid-ice static energy storage','K/day'
1  0 'QTSTOR'	'Total water storage','K/day'

NOTES:
  1) Most of these are budget-related.  Mainly for momentum, but also
       for liquid-ice static energy and moisture.

Third, the handling of conditional statistics has been modified
substantially.  There are now two logical flags (doSAMconditionals --
default=.true. -- and dosatupdnconditional -- default=.false.) in the
PARAMETERS namelist that control their output.  Also, the existing
conditionals should be removed from the lst file, since there is a new
subroutine hbuf_conditions_init() that handles their addition to the
master list in the hbuffer module.

NOTES:
  1) In-cloud averages (suffix: CLD) are always output.
  2) If doSAMconditionals=.true., core (suffix: COR) and downdraft
       core (suffix: CDN) averages will also be output.
  3) If dosatupdnconditionals=.true., cloudy updraft (suffix: SUP),
       cloudy downdraft (suffix: SDN) and cloud-free (suffix: ENV for
       environment) averages will also be output.  Note that the
       threshold for cloud is 10^(-5) kg/kg, so that there may be
       small amounts of cloud water and ice in the environmental air.
  4) The new handling of conditional statistics allows these to be 
       computed in the micro_statistics() routines as well.
  5) Most averages are truly condition: they represent the average
       over grid cells only where the condition is satisfied.  However,
       some accumulate values only in grid cells where the condition is
       true but compute an average as if over the whole domain.  In the
       list below, those lines ending in n denote a conditional average.
       Those lines ending in 0 denote an average over the whole domain
       (while counting only those grid cells where the condition is
       satisfied). 
  6) The stat2nc program has been modified so that missing_values
       (=-9999.) are output in locations where no samples where the
       condition was never satisfied (i.e. where the cloud fraction==0
       for in-cloud averages).  This is helpful when looking at these
       statistics in ncview, among other places.
  7) For each conditional average, the following statistics are
       output (CLD/cloud is used as an example):
