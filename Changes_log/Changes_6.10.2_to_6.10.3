restart.f90 

corrected the bug introduced in 6.10 version that was causing restart MPI-hang-up. 
Fix: move the folloing two lines from the end of read_statement() to the very end (right before return) of the read_all().

        call boundaries(0)
        call boundaries(4)

----------------
setdata.f90

added  call task_barrier() right before call boundaries(4) to avoid potential MPI-hang-up in some rare situations.


----------------
added hbuf_sgs_init.f90 to serve as a wrapper to avoid compilation dependency issues.


----------------
hbuffer.f90

Added call to hbuf_sgs_init()

--------------------

stepout.f90

Added call to sgs_statistics()

---------------------

diagnose.f90

Added call do sgs_diagnose()
