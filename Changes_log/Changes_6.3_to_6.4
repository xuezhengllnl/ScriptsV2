----------------------------------------------------------

Starting from version 6.4, one can add arbitrary number of tracers to be transported in the domain. 
The tracer physics can also be added. First, one needs to specify the number of tracers ntracers in domain.f90. 
A minimal tracer interface can be found in module tracers.f90 . 
What is guaranteed by the code is that the tracers will be advected and mixed around the domain automatically. 
The user only needs to supply initialization code, surface fluxes if different than zero, and physics code that 
describes the change in tracers due to some processes. The code also will output the horizontally averaged 
statistics with the names of tracers as TR01, TR02, etc. Again, only a generic interface is provided,
and it is a user who should insert a specific code except for advection and SGS diffusion 
which is done automatically. In order to do tracers, 
dont forget to set dotracers = .true. in the namelist-file prm.

-----------------------------------------------------------

cloud.f90

Bug in iterative procedure for mixed-phase cloud is fixed. Fortunatelym the
effect of the change was found extremely small, in fact, withing the iteration error itself.
Removed an ice sedimentation block into a new file ice_fall.f90

----------------------------------------------------------------

grid.f90
hbuffer.f90
init.f90
main.f90
periodic.f90
restart.f90
task_boundaries.f90
task_dispatch.f90
stepout.f90

Changes to accomodate the addition of tracres (see above).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

kurant.f90

Bug in handeling the case when ncycle>1 was fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

nudging.f90

Nudging of local values of thermodynamics fields (t and q) to observed profile replaced by
nudging of the horizontal mean profiles.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

precip_proc.f90

changed order of statements to:
 	   qpevp(k) = qpevp(k) - qp(i,j,k)
           qp(i,j,k) = 0.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

main.f90
rad_simple.f90.smoke
rad_simple_dycoms.f90
CAM/rad_full.f90
CCM/rad_full.f90

Changes to implement radiative heating on every subcycle step.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

setforcing.f90" 

fix typo in error messages:

    if(masterproc) print*,'error in grid in lsf'
    if(masterproc) print*,'error in grid in rad'

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

setparm.f90

Move definition of solar_constant and zenith_angle above where the namelist is read


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

surface.f90

momentum flux for is converted to m2/s2 from N/m2/s

was:
            fluxbu(i,j) = taux0
            fluxbv(i,j) = tauy0
now:
            fluxbu(i,j) = taux0/rhow(1)
            fluxbv(i,j) = tauy0/rhow(1)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tke_full.f90

dimfactor was removed. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Radiative heating is now applied every substep when ncycle > 1. Affected files:

main.f90
rad_simple*.f90
RAD_CCM/rad_full.f90
RAD_CAM/rad_full.f90
