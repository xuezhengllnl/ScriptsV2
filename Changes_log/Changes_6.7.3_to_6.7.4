stat_moments.f90 (thanks, Mark Branson)
moment3(i,9,ii,jj)=(qclavg(k,5)/(divfac))      <--- i instead of k 
should be moment3(k,9,ii,jj)= ......    Bug was introduced in SAM6.7.3

cstuff.c (thanks, Mark Branson)
#define systenf SYSTEMF  --> should be "systemf". )introduced probably in SAM6.5. 

surface.f90 (thanks, David Schanen)
qvs y-dimension (0:ny) should be replaced by (1-YES3D:ny) to avoid array bound violation in case of 2D. Bug was introduced in SAM6.7.3.

stepout.f90 
call fminmax_print('sst:',sstxy,0,nx,0,ny,1)
should be 
call fminmax_print('sst:',sstxy,0,nx,1-YES3D,ny,1)
Bug was introduced in SAM6.7.3 after redefining the array bounds of sstxy to deal with the surface fluxes on staggered grid problem. 

tracers.f90 (thanks, Tak Yamaguchi)
Tracer names get lost after restart. Fixed by making the code re-read the tracer names after restart. Affected files tracers.f90, main.f90.


CODE CHANGES (NOT BUGS):

- statistics profiles of tracer fields themselves were not saved to statistics file. Affected files tracers.f90, statistics.f90 (thanks, Tak Yamaguchi)
- added additional entries to initial perturbation list in setperturb.f90 for several GCSS WG1 cases.
- added GCSS WG1 smoke-cloud case and also added dosmoke namelist flag to deal with the smoke-cloud case more or less cleanly. Affected files: drid.f90, main.f90, printout.f90, radiation.f90, setdata.f90, setparm.f90, MICRO_SAM1MOM/microphysics.
- added rad_simple_smoke.f90 to be called when dosmoke=.true. and doradsimple=.true.  Renamed rad_simple_dycoms.f90 to simply rad_simple.f90; called when doradsimple=.true.  and dosmoke=.false.
- Made conform to paper specifications the following GCSS WG1 cases: DYCOMS_RF01, DYCOMS_RF02, BOMEX, GCSSARM
