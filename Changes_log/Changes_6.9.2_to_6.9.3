The bug was introduced to SAM6.9.1 to M2005 microphysics. It artificially reduces the KK2000 autoconversion rate at LES (dx<100m) grid spacings. Those who already downloaded SAM6.9.* , change the following line (in two places) in SRC/MICRO_M2005/module_mp_graupel.f90:

                PRC(K)=(100./dx)**2*1350.*QC3D(K)**2.47*

to

                PRC(K)=min(1.,100./dx)**2*1350.*QC3D(K)**2.47*

Again, do it in two separate places.
