The only difference of 6.10 version from 6.9 version is that all the SGS model has been put in a separate SGS_TKE directory to facilitate easy migration of SGS model to SAM. There are quite a few files affected by this change. The SAM6.10.1 version is based on SAM6.9.4. The new code reproduces the results of 6.9.4 bit-by-bit, that is exactly when run as  with no optimization (the latter can change the order of execution or loops thus affecting the results). The parallel runs were also tested using TOGA case to produce very close results.
Also, the lst file is read now from RUNDATA directory and should not be edited (it never has, actually, so why bother?
