nudging.f90

tnudge and qnudge diagnostics arrays could be computed incorrectly in case of tauls.ne.tautqls, as they used coef=1./tauls rather than coef=1./tautqls. Fixed by adding coef=1./tautqls after nudging the velocity fields. 

RAD_CAM/rad_full.f90
function perpetual_factor()

the variable pie (3.141...) was not defined. As the result the perpetual insolation (doperpetual=.true.) was computed for equator only. Fixed by adding pie=acos(-1.) just before the do while loop.
