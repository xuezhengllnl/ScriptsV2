MICRO_SAM1MOM/cloud.f90

In the cloud condensation procedure, the definition of latent heat for precipitation did not take into account latent heat of freezing. Although the effect of the bug is relatively small but not negligible.

Wrong definition of static energies for the output:

Restartability issues.

Peter Blossey noticed that "It seems that running pressz on restart (called at the end of diagnose) changes things at the level of rounding error as compared to a run without restart." He found a hack that seems to work. Also, fcory and fcorzy apparently were not initialized in restarted runs if doxy=.false. The solution was proposed to move their definition from setdata.f90 to setgrid.f90.
